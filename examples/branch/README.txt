This example shows how to partition data into different models across sites.


To run: python /path/to/COMPASS/COMPASS.py -t example-branch.tre -p HKY85.txt REV.txt


Most branches of the tree will be simulated under an HKY model, while all branches marked 

with a $1 will be simulated under a REV model.
